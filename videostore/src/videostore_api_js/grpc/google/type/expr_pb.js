/**
 * Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL)
 * syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL
 * are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec.
 *
 * Example (Comparison):
 *
 *     title: "Summary size limit"
 *     description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars"
 *     expression: "document.summary.size() < 100"
 *
 * Example (Equality):
 *
 *     title: "Requestor is owner"
 *     description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner"
 *     expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email"
 *
 * Example (Logic):
 *
 *     title: "Public documents"
 *     description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible"
 *     expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'"
 *
 * Example (Data Manipulation):
 *
 *     title: "Notification string"
 *     description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp."
 *     expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)"
 *
 * The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression
 * are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service
 * documentation for additional information.
