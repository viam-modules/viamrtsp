/**
 * #### Introduction
 *
 * The Byte Stream API enables a client to read and write a stream of bytes to
 * and from a resource. Resources have names, and these names are supplied in
 * the API calls below to identify the resource that is being read from or
 * written to.
 *
 * All implementations of the Byte Stream API export the interface defined here:
 *
 * * `Read()`: Reads the contents of a resource.
 *
 * * `Write()`: Writes the contents of a resource. The client can call `Write()`
 *   multiple times with the same resource and can check the status of the write
 *   by calling `QueryWriteStatus()`.
 *
 * #### Service parameters and metadata
 *
 * The ByteStream API provides no direct way to access/modify any metadata
 * associated with the resource.
 *
 * #### Errors
 *
 * The errors returned by the service are in the Google canonical error space.
 *

     * `Write()` is used to send the contents of a resource as a sequence of
     * bytes. The bytes are sent in a sequence of request protos of a client-side
     * streaming RPC.
     *
     * A `Write()` action is resumable. If there is an error or the connection is
     * broken during the `Write()`, the client should check the status of the
     * `Write()` by calling `QueryWriteStatus()` and continue writing from the
     * returned `committed_size`. This may be less than the amount of data the
     * client previously sent.
     *
     * Calling `Write()` on a resource name that was previously written and
     * finalized could cause an error, depending on whether the underlying service
     * allows over-writing of previously written resources.
     *
     * When the client closes the request channel, the service will respond with
     * a `WriteResponse`. The service will not view the resource as `complete`
     * until the client has sent a `WriteRequest` with `finish_write` set to
     * `true`. Sending any requests on a stream after sending a request with
     * `finish_write` set to `true` will cause an error. The client **should**
     * check the `WriteResponse` it receives to determine how much data the
     * service was able to commit and whether the service views the resource as
     * `complete` or not.
